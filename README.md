# AI-Agent-for-Real-Time-Traffic-Prediction
Develop a system that predicts real-time traffic congestion and suggests optimized routes for drivers.

**Technologies:** Machine Learning, Graph Theory, GPS data analysis, Google Maps API
**Goals:** Build an AI that uses live traffic data to optimize routes and avoid congestion.

**Milestones:**
1. Collect and preprocess traffic data from GPS and traffic APIs.
2. Train a model to predict traffic congestion in real-time.
3. Build a recommendation engine that suggests optimal routes based on current and predicted traffic conditions.
